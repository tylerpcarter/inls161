<h3 id="what-it-means-to-us">What it means to us</h3>

<p>Instructors and students at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill adhere to the Code of Student Conduct. 
Accordingly, you all should recognize that most software applications available in the computer lab are copyrighted and cannot be copied.
We will primarily use open source software for this course, which does allow for copying. 
It is important to know the difference and heed the terms of software licences. </p>

<p>We can learn much from each other and we will do that. 
I expect each of you to help each other.
We&#39;ll discuss what we expect in terms of cooperative, collaborative, shared work and the honor code.</p>

<h3 id="honor-code">Honor Code</h3>

<p>It shall be the responsibility of every student at The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill to obey and support the enforcement of the <a href="http://studentconduct.unc.edu/">Honor Code</a>, which prohibits lying, cheating, or stealing when these actions involve academic processes or University, student or academic personnel acting in an official capacity.</p>

<h3 id="campus-code">Campus Code</h3>

<p>It shall be the further responsibility of every student to abide by the <a href="http://studentconduct.unc.edu/honor-system/philosophy">philosophy of the code</a>; namely, to conduct oneself so as not to impair significantly the welfare or the educational opportunities of others in the University community.</p>

<h3 id="instructor-responsibilities">Instructor Responsibilities</h3>

<p>I have a role to play as well, and I will fulfill <a href="http://studentconduct.unc.edu/instructors">these responsibilities</a>.</p>

<p>The system rests on several central tenets:</p>

<p>The university community, including faculty and students, share a commitment to the pursuit of truth, and the dissemination of knowledge to succeeding generations of citizens devoted to the high ideals of personal honor and respect for the rights of others.</p>

<p>These goals can only be achieved in a setting in which intellectual honesty and personal integrity are highly valued; other individuals are trusted, respected, and fairly treated; and the responsibility for articulating and maintaining high standards is widely shared.</p>

<p>Both students and faculty must play active roles in fostering a culture in which honor is prized and acting to remedy violations of community norms relating to academic misconduct, injuries to members of the University community, and conduct that adversely affect University operations and resources.</p>

<p>The principles of academic honesty, integrity, and responsible citizenship govern the performance of all academic work and student conduct at the University as they have during the long life of this institution.</p>

<p>Your acceptance of enrollment in the University presupposes a commitment to the principles embodied in the Code of Student Conduct and a respect for the most significant Carolina tradition.</p>

<p>Your reward is in the practice of these principles.</p>

<p><strong>Your participation in this course comes with the expectation that your work will be completed in full observance of the Honor Code.</strong></p>

<p><em>You are encouraged to work together with your fellow students and to share knowledge and learning.</em></p>

<p>However, academic dishonesty in any form is unacceptable, because any breach in academic integrity, however small, strikes destructively at the University&#39;s life and work.</p>

<h3 id="diversity">Diversity</h3>

<p>In support of the University&#39;s diversity goals and the mission of the School of Information and Library Science, SILS embraces diversity as an ethical and societal value.</p>

<p>We broadly define diversity to include race, gender, national origin, ethnicity, religion, social class, age, sexual orientation and physical and learning ability.</p>

<p>As an academic community committed to preparing our graduates to be leaders in an increasingly multicultural and global society we strive to:</p>

<ul>
<li>  Ensure inclusive leadership, policies and practices;</li>
<li>  Integrate diversity into the curriculum and research;</li>
<li>  Foster a mutually respectful intellectual environment in which diverse opinions are valued;</li>
<li>  Recruit traditionally underrepresented groups of students, faculty and staff; and</li>
<li>  Participate in outreach to underserved groups in the State.</li>
</ul>

<p>The statement represents a commitment of resources to the development and maintenance of an academic environment that is open, representative, reflective and committed to the concepts of equity and fairness.</p>

<p>Remember, on occasion you may have felt yourself to be a member of a minority group, picked on by a majority group. 
Here at school, you may find those roles reversed. 
Do not fall prey to the temptation to use your new majority sensibility to get back at those who may have picked on you in the past, when you were in a minority group. 
<em>Treating others as you would have them treat you is always a good rule to follow.</em></p>
