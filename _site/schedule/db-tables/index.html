<h2 id="tables">Tables</h2>

<p>The basic storage template in a database is a table. </p>

<p>This is simply a set of data arranged into columns and rows. 
Just like with the data that we generated previously, the rows represent lists of information that are related to a specific thing. </p>

<p>The rows in our tables are called &quot;records.&quot;</p>

<p>The columns then represent the types of information that we are organizing. </p>

<p>Tables on their own are fine for storing a collection of data, but what if we have a lot of repeating data that we do not want to have to store over and over again in the same table?</p>

<h3 id="relationships">Relationships</h3>

<p>The primary method of reducing this sort of data is by creating more tables and then defining relationships between them. </p>

<p>There are three categories of relationship:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-" data-lang="">* One-to-One: Each record in a table has only one relationship to one other record in another table
* One-to-Many: Each record (by primary key) in a table can have zero, one, or many relationships to records in other tables. 
* Many-to-Many: Each record in a table can have any number of (or zero) relationships to records in other tables. 
</code></pre></div>
<p>Can you think of any examples of relationships like this? </p>

<p>Please read the following post about defining relationships in relational databases:</p>

<p>Harkins, S. (2003, April 30). Relational databases: Defining relationships between database tables. Retrieved from <a href="http://www.techrepublic.com/article/relational-databases-defining-relationships-between-database-tables/">http://www.techrepublic.com/article/relational-databases-defining-relationships-between-database-tables/</a></p>

<p>The whole TechRepublic series on relational databases is useful. It would be worthwhile to read all of it. </p>

<h3 id="primary-keys">Primary Keys</h3>

<p>A primary key, as mentioned above, is a designator associated with each record that distinguishes it from all other records. 
When creating a table with a one-to-many relationship, you will need to create a primary key for each new record. </p>

<p>What are some possible pieces of existing information that might be used as a primary key?</p>

<p>What might be some problems with using an existing piece of information as a primary key?</p>

<h3 id="base">Base</h3>

<p>We&#39;re going to explore importing a table in LibreOffice Base. 
If we have time, we will jump ahead and look at adding forms. </p>

<p><strong>For tomorrow:</strong></p>

<p>Please have a look through the Base Handbook, provided by the LibreOffice community and the Open Document Foundation:</p>

<p><a href="https://wiki.documentfoundation.org/images/e/e8/BH40-BaseHandbook.pdf">https://wiki.documentfoundation.org/images/e/e8/BH40-BaseHandbook.pdf</a></p>

<p>It will help you to familiarize yourselves with some of the terminology involved in creating, designing, using and maintaining databases. </p>

<p>Look through the Base Tutorial, in the sections on tables and relationships (chapter 1):</p>

<p><a href="https://wiki.documentfoundation.org/images/0/02/Base_tutorial.pdf">https://wiki.documentfoundation.org/images/0/02/Base_tutorial.pdf</a></p>

<p>It would be a good idea for you to also look ahead to chapters 7-10 in the Base Tutorial. 
We will be covering these topics over the rest of this week. </p>
