## Evaluation

This class has no exams, but there are 6 major tasks that will correspond to one of the major objectives in the course. 
These include a final presentation which will be made during the scheduled final exam period. 
All of the tasks are interconnected, so it is important to complete the tasks in succession by the due dates listed in the chart below. 

### Tasks

| **Task** | **Components** | **%** | **Due date** |  
| :------- | :------------- | ----: | -----------: |  
| [Basics]({{ base.url }}/syllabus/assignments/assignment1/) | CodeAnywhere, GitHub setup | 20 | Week 1 |  
| [Web]({{ base.url }}/syllabus/assignments/assignment2/) | Site published on GitHub Pages | 20 | 6 July |  
| [Text]({{ base.url }}/syllabus/assignments/assignment3/) | Create formatted text document | 15 | 13 July |  
| [Spreadsheet]({{ base.url }}/syllabus/assignments/assignment4/) | Create and format spreadsheets | 5 | 15 July |  
| DB | [Create a database from tables]({{ base.url }}/syllabus/assignments/assignment5/) | 15 | 22 July |  
| Present | [Create and record a presentation]({{ base.url }}/syllabus/assignments/assignment6/) | 15 | 27 July |  
| Participation | Come to class, Share resources | 10 | N/A |  

### Due Dates

Each task is due by the end of the day (midnight) on the date specified. 
It would be a good idea to turn things in before that deadline so that you can get a jump on the next section. 
The last assignment (the presentation) will be due before the exam date, but will be presented to the rest of the class on the exam day. 

### Submitting Assignments

All of your assignments will be submitted using GitHub, as this is where you will store your course materials and personal website. 
Learning how to use this system is built into the first assignment. 
Particular requirements and instructions for assignments and submission will be discussed in class and included in the lecture notes. 

[Information about individual assignments is listed here]({{ base.url }}/syllabus/assignments/).

### Participation

In addition to the 6 tasks, participation will be evaluated and included in the evaluation scheme. 
Participation, of course, means coming to class: that is mandatory. 
It also means bringing something to the class by way of discussion or links shared with the rest of the class. 
Since we are a small class this summer, we will decide on the first day how best to accomplish the sharing of resources.
