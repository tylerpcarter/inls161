# {{ page.title }}

**Due: 2015-07-06

This is the first assignment with a real deliverable attached to it. 

The taskset is relatively straightforward:

1. Build a webpage to place some information about yourself and manage your other assignments.
2. Place this website in your GitHub repository. The repository should be called `[USERNAME].github.io`. This will result in a website at `http://[USERNAME].github.io`. 
3. Demonstrate, through making changes and designing your template and files that you understand the basics of using HTML5, CSS3 (and possibly Jekyll and other tools) for web design and presentation. 

You have choices as to how you go about this. 

1. You may write a complete website from scratch, if you are feeling industrious. Be sure to review the documentation for GitHub Pages, since that is the backend that will be serving your work: https://help.github.com/articles/creating-project-pages-manually/
2. You can clone an HTML5/CSS3 base template into your repo or fork the template into your account and then rename it `[USERNAME].github.io`. A good template for this is here: https://github.com/impressivewebs/Easy-HTML5-Template
2. You can clone or fork a theme from http://jekyllthemes.org and then make changes to the CSS and underlying structure. This will mean learning a few things about the underlying structure of Jekyll, which we will go through in class. 

Whether you start from scratch or from a template, you will still need to make the site your own and place your information into it. 
Remember, this will be the place where you put the rest of your assignments for this class. 

## Grading

Grading for the website will be primarily based on your ability to get it up and running and to place content in it. 

On Monday, I will take a snapshot of your repos and give you feedback based on that. 
If anything in the feedback has an effect on your grade for the assignment, then you will have the opportunity in the weeks that follow to make any recommended changes and resubmit for consideration. 

I expect for your website to change over the course of the next few weeks because we will be using it for the class. 
Given that, your final grade for this assignment will not be permanently assigned until the end of class. 
Your final grade, however, will take into account the initial grade that you receive for the assignment. 
It will be a weighted average of the two. 

The website is worth 20% of your total grade, so make it good.
