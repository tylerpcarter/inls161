Today we are going to wrap up the class and talk about the skills that you are taking away from this experience. 
<excerpt/>

This information will be useful in the context of preparing a resume/CV or perhaps in conducting a job interview in which you are asked to talk about technical skills.

# Skills and tools
I asked the class to identify the major skillsets that we engaged in learning this semester and recorded the output on the whiteboard.{% marginnote 'skillsets' 'Students listed the skillsets they thought they had been exposed to.<a href="/assets/img/learned-skillsets.jpg"><img src="/assets/img/learned-skillsets.jpg" alt="Whiteboard image of skillset list" /></a>' %} 


I then followed this request by linking those skillsets to the tools used in engaging them. 
The images represent the output from this discussion.{% marginnote 'tools' 'Students also listed the tools used in engaging those skillsets.<a href="/assets/img/learned-tools.jpg"><img src="/assets/img/learned-tools.jpg" alt="Whiteboard image of tool list" /></a>' %}

Following this, I talked briefly about how these skillsets might be engaged by other SILS courses and tried to link them accordingly. These courses are either related directly to the skillset or they make use of the skillset in some significant way.

The table that follows organizes all of this information in a more straightforward manner (with some additions of mine).
