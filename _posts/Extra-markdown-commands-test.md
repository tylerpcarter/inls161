Speed up Your Workflow with Markdown Keyboard Shortcuts
Writing Markdown is pretty quick right out of the box, but you can speed it up even further by getting to know the keyboard shortcuts in your editor of choice. These all tend to be a little different, but in Ghost you can access some on-the-fly formatting very easily:

Ctrl + B for Bold
Ctrl + I for Italic
Ctrl + K for a link
Tap Ctrl + H multiple times for the most common H2 and H3
There are lots more included in the Markdown Help overlay in the editor. Regardless of which app you use to write, it's work figuring out the Markdown keyboard shortcuts available to speed up your workflow.
