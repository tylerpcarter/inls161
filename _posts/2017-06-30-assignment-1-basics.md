This assignment is simple. 
It consists of 5 tasks:

1. Sign up for a [GitHub](https://github.com) account and log into [CodeAnywhere](https://codeanywhere.com) (we did this on the first day of class). 
3. Take the [first quiz](/quiz). 
2. Take the [beginning questionnaire](https://unc.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_6ulF2GSI4FKFJCR). 
4. Return your signed [grade contract](https://inls161.johndmart.in/syllabus/inls161-suii2017-gradecontract.pdf).
5. Read the [syllabus](/syllabus) all the way to the end. Look out for dinosaurs.

Once you have done these, you have completed the first assignment. 
You will likely have done these things by the time we finish class at the end of the first week.
