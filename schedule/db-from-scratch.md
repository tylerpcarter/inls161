Now we are actually going to build a database. 
We'll start by importing some tables and then we'll link them up and make queries against them. 

Please look at this documentation for LibreOffice Base for how to import tables:

[Importing and Exporting Data in Base](https://help.libreoffice.org/Common/Importing_and_Exporting_Data_in_Base)

We will be doing this today in class. 

The tables that we need to import into our database are available [at this link]({{ base.url }}/raw-material/161-database-tables.ods).

Next up: [Queries]({{ base.url}}/schedule/queries/).
