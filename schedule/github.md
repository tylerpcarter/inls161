GitHub is a platform that allows for users to keep copies of their open source, plaintext repositories online, in a single centralized location. 
It also adds a social interaction layer to the process of managing version-controlled source files. 

It is useful for (and used by) software development projects as well as other plaintext-based projects, such as collaborative authoring of books and articles. 

It is particularly good for keeping track of projects that involve both plaintext source code or markup and files related to work that will be published using that code. 

Today we are going to learn to set up a repository locally

Tomorrow we will learn to push it to GitHub. 
We will also learn to set up a repository remotely on GitHub and then copy it locally. 

For this purpose, we will follow this guide, for the most part:  

Orsini, L. (2013). [GitHub For Beginners: Don't Get Scared, Get Started](http://readwrite.com/2013/09/30/understanding-github-a-journey-for-beginners-part-1). Retrieved from http://readwrite.com/2013/09/30/understanding-github-a-journey-for-beginners-part-1

It has much the same information as some of the other articles and books referenced in our course site, but it strings the different parts together and makes for a useful review resource.

Since we will have already created repos, we may want to have a look at this to see how we can get our repo into GitHub: https://help.github.com/articles/adding-an-existing-project-to-github-using-the-command-line/

**For next time:**

Please review the following documents about licensing:

Tomorrow we will have a guest, John Nelson, who will talk to us about licensing and the implications of storing your code online. 
John practices business law and focuses on copyright and intellectual property.
