### Edward Tufte

Edward Tufte is a statistician and artist and Professor Emeritus at Yale University. 
If you ever have a chance to go to one of his workshops, you absolultely should do so. 

Have a look through his website: http://www.edwardtufte.com

Tufte has led the charge for years that in order to communicate research and ideas, we need to pay close attention to aesthetics. 

Beautifully designed communication is better at convincing others and transmitting knowledge than ugly or clunky communication. 

### The Cognitive Style of PowerPoint

As we mentioned earlier, PowerPoint is not the problem. 

We are the problem. 

We expect presentations to be boring and hideous, and so they are. 

We expect that no one will pay attention to our boring and hideous presentations, and so they don't. 

*	We are lazy. 
*	We don't think that we can do any better. 
*	We are wrong about that. 

And it is not our fault. 

We have been trained and cajoled and led into doing things in the same way over and over and over again. 

You all have the opportunity to be better, to do better. 

Here is an example of an excellent presentation:

[Getting the Network the World Needs - Lawrence Lessig](http://blip.tv/lessig/getting-the-network-the-world-needs-1946961)

Lawrence Lessig's presentation style is widely recognized as being among the best in the business right now. 

We want to aim for this kind of scripted presentation for our final projects in this class. 

**For tomorrow:**

Please read this blog post from a decade ago (that is still as relevant as ever) and watch the two presentation linked at the end. 

[The "Lessig Method" of Presentation - Garr Reynolds - Presentation Zen](http://presentationzen.blogs.com/presentationzen/2005/10/the_lessig_meth.html)

Finally, choose a topic and write a paragraph summarizing the topic that you would like to present and why you wish to do so.
